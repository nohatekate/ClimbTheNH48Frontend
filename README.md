# Climb The NH 48


## Description
Climb The NH 48 is an app to track your hikes and summits of the 48 4000 foot White Mountains located in NH. When you've summited all 48 peaks you can apply to the AMC Four Thousand Footer Club. When I first climbed these mountains we kept track of our hikes on a piece of paper. My plan for this app was to give hikers a clean, simple, and convenient way to keep track their hikes and progress.

## Planned Future Enhancements

  - My future plans for this app include sorting the main page of mountains. I very much would like to get users the ability to add photos to their hikes. I plan to add a hikes detail page and possibly a progress view page. Very future plans would include tagging other users in your hikes details. I'd like the user to have the ability to delete their profile as well. I plan to add an option to export a pdf of the application to apply for for the amc 4000 footer club with the users hike details auto populated on the form.
