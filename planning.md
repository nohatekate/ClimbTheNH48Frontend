## MVP
- Climb The NH 48 is an app that will allow a user to register and keep track of which 4000 foot mountains they have climed. When tracking their climbed mountains they will be able to create details and update the details of the climb. The logged in user will be able to see a list of their climbed mountains on their profile page. They will be able to delete their profile.
- I would like to add photos again with S3, but I saw the post about needing proof of concept to do that so maybe it's much more difficult to add in a MERN stack app. Possibly an icebox feature if I'm able to hit MVP and style decently before the weekend.
